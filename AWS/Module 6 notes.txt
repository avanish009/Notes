Module 6

> Shared responsibility model

eg. A house 
constructor - with 4 strong walls and doors 

you - to close and lock the doors


if you install OS on Ec2 instance 
AWS cannot access it 
the cannot deploy anything that destroys your system
its users responsibility to maintain them


AWS provide everyone with toolset they need to for their data to authorise some individual 
or lock it down so no one can access it

> User permission and access


AWS root user :  can access and control anything - turn on multi-factor authentication 

AWS identity and access management (IAM)

bydefault - no permission (0)
has to explicitly gives permission 

Principle of least privileage : A user is granted access only to what they need 

IAM policy to a IAM user 
A JSON document that describes what API call a user can and cannot make


Effect :Either Allow or Deny
Action : Any AWS api call
Resource : Which AWS resource the API call is for

Policies : document that describe permission that you can attach it into the group 

IAM group : easier to manage permission
		attach the policies to the group 


identities in AWS called "Roles"
-temporary amount of time 
-assume to gain temporary access 
-when it assumes the role it abandons the previous permissions and uses this role

> AWS Organizations

A central location to manage multiple AWS accounts
-centralized management of all those account eg.A, B, C
-Consolidated billing 
-Hierarchial groupings

Service control policies(SCPs)
you can restrict aws resource users and roles each member account and an organizational user can access

> Compliance

Consumer data in EU : GDPR  General data protection regulation
Healthcare app in US : HIPPA Health insuarance portability and accountability act

AWS will not automatically replicate data in other regions

AWS Artifacts
-you can gain access to compliance reports done by third parties who have validated a wide range of compliance standards.

> Distributed Denial-of-service attacks (DDoS)


overwhelming the system that it can not operate
zombie bots : brainlessely attack your system
unbearable load that they cannot process

UDP FLOOD : weather request <-> gimme weather | solution security group

HTTP LEVEL ATTACK : zombified attack
Slowloris attack : attacker pretends to have terribly slow connection    | solution Elastic load balancer
				until they gey get entire packet they cannot move on to other request

For sharpest and most sophiesticated
AWS shield with AWS WAF (ML capabelities)

> Additional security services
Encryption hat's the notion of encryption, which is securing a message or data in a way that can only be accessed by authorized parties.

Encryption at rest : when data is idle eg. serverside DynamoDB KMS (Key Management service )
	     in transit : from A to B rg. Redshift we use ssl secure socket layer 

Amazon Inspector : by running an automated security assistance against to you infrastructure
Amazon Agent

threat detection offering known as "Amazon GuardDuty"

AWS IAM 
user no permission
groups grouping of user 
roles temp access
policies to gain access to identites
identity federation : role based access 
multifactor auth. esp for root user
